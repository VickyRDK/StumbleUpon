This is a Binary sequence classification problem where we need to differentiate
a paragraph upon its ability to stay relevant through times i.e. evergreen or ephemeral.

The main approach I used to solve the problem is using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
for sequence classification which is a pretrained word embedding transformer in pytorch.

## Dataset:

1. 


## Training
1. Run the stumbleupon.ipynb file

## Evaluation
1. For evaluation, the model is evaluated on the validation dataset and the corresponding 
classification report is generated with precision and recall for each classes.
